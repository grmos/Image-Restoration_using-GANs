# Image-Restoration_using-GANs

## Target
The target of this project is to restore the image from low to high resolution and is based on [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14036.pdf)
## Enviroment

## Usage
## Results
- Target image is created from the generator

In this picture we see the image that we want to restore ("lowres"), the target image ("real image") the result if we apply      bicubic interpolation and the result from the method based on GANs

In this picture it looks how method is searching for the target image

- Target image is a real world image
